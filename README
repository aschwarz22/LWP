There are a few warnings that pop up when compiling, but they are all caused by initializing the scheduler,
which was done according to the specs.

There are no bugs as far as we can tell, however we had some confusion concerning the schedulers.
We have a default scheduler, RoundRobin. We initialized the scheduler with the default RoundRoubin scheduler
functions included in lwp.c. We do not have a seperate scheduler file. 

We also did not implement any other schedulers because no other non-preemptive schedulers were mentioned in class.

The given example programs (hungrymain.c, snakemain.c, numbersmain.c) were modified to include "lwp.c" instead of "lwp.h".
